# Game Ideas
## Traps:
- Laser that shoots in a straight line, fires in bursts on a fixed interval and duration.
- Drones that fly around the map and shoot players (??with lasers??)
## Platforms:
- Mirrorred surface platforms, that reflect lasers
- Or metal platforms, that also reflect lasers
## Maps:
- Windy map, the wind happens in dynamic intervals inbetween gusts of wind with dynamic duration and force applied on the players.
- Additional gravitational pulls on the player. Little moons on the map that pull the player toward them. Player still has regular Earth gravity downward that is greater than any of the gravitational pulls of the moons, that way the player's normal is still upwards. Start at bottom and the finish is at the top. They have to jump their way to the top trying to get away from the gravity pulls.
